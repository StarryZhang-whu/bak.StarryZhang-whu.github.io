## About Me

Hey there! üëã I'm Linghao Zhang, a final year undergrad majoring in Software Engineering at Wuhan University, where I was advised by [Peng Liang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peng-Liang-4) and [Chong Wang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chong-Wang-13). Currently, I'm a research intern at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/). I‚Äôm also very fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Saikat Dutta](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~saikatd/) from Cornell for wonderful months. I'm dedicated to the intersection of **Software Engineering** and **AI**, and I'm particularly interested in SE research that has practical implications.

*I'm looking for a PhD position in 25Fall.*
