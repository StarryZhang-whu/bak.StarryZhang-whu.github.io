## About Me

Hey there! üëã I'm Linghao, a final year undergrad at Wuhan University. Currently, I'm a research intern at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/). I am fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Saikat Dutta](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~saikatd/) from Cornell for wonderful months. I'm dedicated to the intersection of **Software Engineering** and **ML**, my goals are (1) building advanced code intelligence systems to help people create great software, and conversely, (2) leveraging best practices from SE to guide the developing, testing, and maintaining software systems with ML components.

## Research Interests

- **ML for SE:** Language Models for SE, Evaluating and Benchmarking for Code LLMs.
- **SE for ML:** MLOps ([MLflow](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow), [Metaflow](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow)), Software Testing for ML-based Systems.
- **Mining Software Repositories:** GitHub, Software Heritage, and other code sources at large-scale, CI/CD, OSS.

## News

- **[May. 2025]** SWE-bench Goes Live! I‚Äôm very excited to share our latest work, [SWE-bench-Live](https://swe-bench-live.github.io/). We‚Äôve built a live, continuously updatable benchmark for issue resolving, offering a more rigorous and contamination-free evaluation for Code LLMs.
- **[Jan. 2025]** Our latest paper, [DI-Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13699), is now available on arXiv! We introduce a novel CI-based benchmark curation pipeline for software engineering tasks at the repository level. (Accepted to ACL Findings 2025 ü•≥)
- **[Aug. 2024]** ü•≥ I will be joining [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) (MSRA Shanghai, [DKI Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/)) as a research intern. Ping me if you are in Shanghai and want to grab a meal together!
- **[Jun. 2024]** üßê Check out our latest work [üîéREACT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05514) exploring how commit message generation can be enhanced by retrieving similar examples!
- **[Dec. 2023]** ü§† My academic rookie has been accepted by SANER 2024 ERA track, have a look if you are interested in [LLM for CMG](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10589767)!
