## About Me

Hey there! üëã I'm Linghao, a final year undergrad at Wuhan University. Currently, I'm a research intern at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/). I am fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Saikat Dutta](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~saikatd/) from Cornell for wonderful months. I'm dedicated to the intersection of **Software Engineering** and **ML**, my goals are (1) building advanced code intelligence systems to help people create great software, and conversely, (2) leveraging best practices from SE to guide the developing, testing, and maintaining software systems with ML components.

*I'm looking for a PhD position in 25Fall.*


## Research Interests

- **ML for SE:** Language Models for SE, Evaluating and Benchmarking for Code LLMs.
- **SE for ML:** MLOps ([MLflow](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow), [Metaflow](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow)), Software Testing for ML-based Systems.
- **Mining Software Repositories:** GitHub, Software Heritage, and other code sources at large-scale, CI/CD, OSS.

## News
