## About Me

Hey there! üëã I'm Linghao. I received my Bachelor in Software Engineering from Wuhan University in 2025. Previously, I worked as a research intern at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/), advised by [Shilin He](https://shilinhe.github.io/) and [Yu Kang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kay/). I was also fortunate to work with [Prof. Saikat Dutta](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~saikatd/) from Cornell for wonderful months.

I build something verifiable and scalable for code.

## Research Interests

- **ML for SE:** Language Models for Code, Evaluating and Benchmarking for Code LLMs. 
- **SE for ML:** MLOps, MLSys, Software Testing for ML-based Systems.

## News

- **[May. 2025]** [[Media Coverage]](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/mWWlI-AEhtbFt-xzOYlyjQ) [[Twitter Thread]](https://x.com/BowenLi2121/status/1930247387328762209) SWE-bench Goes Live! I‚Äôm very excited to share our latest work, [SWE-bench-Live](https://swe-bench-live.github.io/). We‚Äôve built a live, continuously updatable benchmark for issue resolving, offering a more rigorous and contamination-free evaluation for Code LLMs. 
- **[Jan. 2025]** Our latest paper, [DI-Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13699), is now available on arXiv! We introduce a novel CI-based benchmark curation pipeline for software engineering tasks at the repository level. (Accepted to ACL Findings 2025 ü•≥)
- **[Aug. 2024]** ü•≥ I will be joining [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) (MSRA Shanghai, [DKI Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/)) as a research intern. Ping me if you are in Shanghai and want to grab a meal together!
- **[Jun. 2024]** üßê Check out our latest work [üîéREACT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05514) exploring how commit message generation can be enhanced by retrieving similar examples!
- **[Dec. 2023]** ü§† My academic rookie has been accepted by SANER 2024 ERA track, have a look if you are interested in [LLM for CMG](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10589767)!
